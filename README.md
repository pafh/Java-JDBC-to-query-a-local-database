# Java-JDBC-to-query-a-local-database
The program asks the user for an event number. A heading is displayed (see example) followed by the number of participants for that event. Next, a detailed list (i.e. first and last name) of all the participants for that event is displayed, together with the performance in minutes. If no performance is recorded yet for a participant, ‘***’ should be outputted. The list should be sorted by the performance. Also, the first and last name of the winner for each event (if any) should be printed. If there is no male/female winner, the name should be replaced by ‘***’. This is repeated until the user enters a ‘0’. In that case, the program should display the message ‘END OF SESSION’.
